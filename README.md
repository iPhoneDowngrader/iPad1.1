This method is tested, and should not brick your iPad. A restore should fix any issue you cause.<br />
BACKUP BEFORE TRYING!<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you want jailbroken 5.1.1, unless you have a good reason (I cannot think of one) use redsn0w's "jailbreak" button.<br />
NOTE2: If you have SHSH for your device, use iFaith<br />
<br />
How to use:<br />
Requirements:<br />
1) A4 or lower device (iPhone 4 or lower, iPod Touch 4 or lower, iPad 1)<br />
2) iTunes (11.0.5 or older, 11.1 patches the exploit. I am using iTunes 10.7)<br />
3) My downgrade IPSW, download above.<br />
4) Official Apple IPSW (http://ipsw.me/iPad1,1)<br />
BOTH IPSW FILES SHOULD BE THE SAME VERSION!<br />
You may have success using 4.2.1 on 4.2 for example, but I recommend not risking it.<br />
5) About 10 minutes. Depends on computer speed.<br />
Steps:<br />
1) Enter PWNED DFU, use iREB or Redsn0w<br />
2) Open iTunes<br />
3) When iTunes says there is an iDevice in recovery mode, click OK.<br />
4) Shift-click (or option-click if you are on a mac) Restore.<br />
5) Select the iPhoneGuy1101.Downgrade.[DEVICE].[FIRMWARE].ipsw file you downloaded earlier.<br />
6) Once the restore is done, iTunes should spit out an error (37, for example, yours may vary). Continue to step 7.<br />
7) Open RedSn0w 0.9.15b.<br />
8) Click extras, then select ipsw. Select the Apple Official IPSW. It should recognize the version.<br />
9) Click Just Boot. It will display either a pwnapple, or, if you enabled it, verbose boot (arguments = -v)<br />
10) Enjoy old version of iOS! (and maybe vote up my post? :p)<br /><br/>
UPDATED) I just added some NoJailbreak copies for versions sn0wbreeze does not recognize. If you used a NoJailbreak copy (look at filename, example of nojailbreak would be iPhoneGuy1101.Downgrade.NoJailbreak.iPhone4-GSM-revA.4.3.5) repeat step 8, click Jailbreak on the main menu, and complete the tutorial starting at step 8.<br/><br/>
