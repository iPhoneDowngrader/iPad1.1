 This method is tested, and should not brick your iPad. A restore should fix any issue you cause.
 BACKUP BEFORE TRYING!
 
 NOTE: If you want jailbroken 5.1.1, unless you have a good reason (I cannot think of one) use redsn0w's "jailbreak" button.
 NOTE2: If you have SHSH for your device, use iFaith
 
How to use:
  Requirements:
       1) iPad1,1
       2) iTunes (11.0.5 or older, 11.1 patches the exploit. I am using iTunes 10.7)
       3) My downgrade IPSW, download above.
       4) Official Apple IPSW (http://ipsw.me/iPad1,1)
          BOTH IPSW FILES SHOULD BE THE SAME VERSION!
          You may have success using 4.2.1 on 4.2 for example, but I recommend not risking it.
       5) About 10 minutes. Depends on computer speed.
  Steps:
       1) Enter PWNED DFU, use iREB or Redsn0w
       2) Open iTunes
       3) When iTunes says there is an iPad in recovery mode, click OK.
       4) Shift-click (or option-click if you are on a mac) Restore.
       5) Select the iPhoneGuy1101.Downgrade.iPad.[FIRMWARE].ipsw file you downloaded earlier.
       6) Once the restore is done, iTunes should spit out an error (37, for example, yours may vary). Continue to step 7.
       7) Open RedSn0w 0.9.15b.
       8) Click extras, then select ipsw. Select the Apple Official IPSW. It should recognize the version.
       9) Click Just Boot. It will display either a pwnapple, or, if you enabled it, verbose boot (arguments = -v)
       10) Enjoy old version of iOS!
