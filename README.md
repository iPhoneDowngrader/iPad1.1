 This method is tested, and should not brick your iPad. A restore should fix any issue you cause.<br />
 BACKUP BEFORE TRYING!<br />
 <br />
 NOTE: If you want jailbroken 5.1.1, unless you have a good reason (I cannot think of one) use redsn0w's "jailbreak" button.<br />
 NOTE2: If you have SHSH for your device, use iFaith<br />
 <br />
How to use:<br />
  Requirements:<br />
       1) iPad1,1<br />
       2) iTunes (11.0.5 or older, 11.1 patches the exploit. I am using iTunes 10.7)<br />
       3) My downgrade IPSW, download above.<br />
       4) Official Apple IPSW (http://ipsw.me/iPad1,1)<br />
          BOTH IPSW FILES SHOULD BE THE SAME VERSION!<br />
          You may have success using 4.2.1 on 4.2 for example, but I recommend not risking it.<br />
       5) About 10 minutes. Depends on computer speed.<br />
  Steps:<br />
       1) Enter PWNED DFU, use iREB or Redsn0w<br />
       2) Open iTunes<br />
       3) When iTunes says there is an iPad in recovery mode, click OK.<br />
       4) Shift-click (or option-click if you are on a mac) Restore.<br />
       5) Select the iPhoneGuy1101.Downgrade.iPad.[FIRMWARE].ipsw file you downloaded earlier.<br />
       6) Once the restore is done, iTunes should spit out an error (37, for example, yours may vary). Continue to step 7.<br />
       7) Open RedSn0w 0.9.15b.<br />
       8) Click extras, then select ipsw. Select the Apple Official IPSW. It should recognize the version.<br />
       9) Click Just Boot. It will display either a pwnapple, or, if you enabled it, verbose boot (arguments = -v)<br />
       10) Enjoy old version of iOS!<br />
